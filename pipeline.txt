# standardize data after polynomial basis expansion?
# function to generate test predictions?.....
# implement confusion matrix....
# remove features 15, 18, 20
# balance dataset?....
# remove 30% of 40% dataset containing nans and misses (to balance dataset!!!!!)
# test newton's method, random forest?...

- shuffle data!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- weights: try to use and don't use them 

- relationship tra bilanciamento e weights : NON ESISTONO

- -999 -> mean

- Different approaches to dealing with -999 values

- Which features are always corrupted

- Eliminate linearly dependent rows/ columns

- normalize data/ limit ranges??.....

- checking for linear dependence; before or after basis expansion?...

- Relationships between features : covariance matrix

- Distributions of the variables

- Polynomial expansion

- Compare different model types

- which loss functions to use??
